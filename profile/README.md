## What is AltTab?  

AltTab is a lightweight macOS utility that transforms how you switch between open apps and windows. It recreates the familiar **Alt+Tab experience from Windows**, letting users view all running applications with visual thumbnails and navigate quickly with the keyboard.  

Perfect for users transitioning from Windows or anyone who prefers a more intuitive multitasking tool, AltTab integrates seamlessly into macOS. You can customize shortcuts, choose themes, adjust transparency, and even control how app icons are displayed.
